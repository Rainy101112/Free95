# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the newest version of Free95 will be supported for vulnerability issues or bugs because they may have been patched out.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Create a issue**:
Create an issue describing the possible vulnerability you may have found and go into as many details as possible, if you are willing to help make a PR that would patch the exploit that would be greatly appreciated.
